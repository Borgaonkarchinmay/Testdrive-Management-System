# Testdrive-Management-System

Purpose of Project:
Our DBMS project idea is to develop a Testdrive management system for a car dealership. Our project aims to make the process of booking and managing testdrives more convenient for both the customers and the dealershipâ€™s testdrive manager. 
Since most of the dealerships still maintain a handwritten register and most of the communication is verbal and due to this documenting the information for future use becomes cumbersome. 
Our Testdrive management system makes this entire process more convenient by acting as bridge between customers and dealership authority as well as maintaining the realtime status of a testdrive in a database.

Design Overview: 
Our Testdrive management system consists of two user roles (customer, manager). Both the users gets to use features of the system relevant to their role.
